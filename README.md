## Introduction

Welcome to VendX: the E-Commerce Website Template with an Admin Panel!

This application provides a complete solution for managing and displaying products, categories, and orders, complete with user authentication and a fully functional admin dashboard.

> **NOTE**: This project is based on a tutorial by Code With Antonio (https://youtu.be/5miHyP6lExg). 

> Please note that this project is not an exact replica of the one shown in the video due to differences in the tech stack:

> Next.js 13 → Next.js 14 | Prisma → Drizzle | Recharts → shadcn/ui charts

> This project was created primarily to learn Drizzle, but it also serves as a comprehensive e-commerce template.
